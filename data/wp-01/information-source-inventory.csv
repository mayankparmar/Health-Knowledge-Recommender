# Created: WP-01 Foundation Research Phase
# Total Sources: 25 initial sources identified
# Source Selection Criteria:
#   - Authoritative organization (WHO, national health services, medical institutions, professional societies)
#   - Evidence-based content (systematic reviews, clinical guidelines, peer-reviewed information)
#   - Publicly accessible (preference for open access; some clinical guidelines may require subscription)
#   - Comprehensive coverage (stages, care, symptoms, management)
#   - Updated regularly (currency of information)
#   - Multiple target audiences (patients, caregivers, professionals)
# Geographic Diversity: Global (WHO, ADI), United States, United Kingdom, Europe, Australia, Canada, Japan
# Content Type Distribution:
#   - Clinical Guidelines: 7 sources
#   - Educational Resources: 12 sources
#   - Policy/Strategy Documents: 3 sources

#   - Patients: 18 sources
#   - Caregivers: 20 sources
#   - Healthcare Professionals: 15 sources
#   - Policymakers: 4 sources
#   - Researchers: 6 sources
# Extraction Priority for WP-03:
#   - High priority (comprehensive stage-specific information): SRC-001 to SRC-012, SRC-015, SRC-017 to SRC-022
#   - Medium priority (specialized or regional): SRC-013, SRC-014, SRC-016, SRC-023 to SRC-025
#   - Low priority (data/policy focus): SRC-002
# Language Coverage:
#   - English: All sources

#   - Multiple languages: 4 sources (WHO resources)
# Stage Coverage Analysis:
#   - All stages covered: 14 sources
#   - Specific stage focus: 5 sources (mostly mid-late stages for ADL care)
#   - General/diagnostic: 6 sources
# ADL/IADL Coverage:
#   - Both ADL and IADL: 13 sources
#   - Partial coverage: 8 sources
#   - Limited/None: 4 sources
# Next Steps for WP-03:
#   1. Extract information from each source systematically
#   2. Categorize by topics (30+ expected: symptoms, diagnosis, stages, medications, ADL support, IADL support, behavioral symptoms, etc.)
#   3. Map information items to FAST stages and ADL/IADL impairments
#   4. Assign target audiences (patient/caregiver/both)
#   5. Track page-level references for all extracted information
# Expansion Opportunities:
#   - Additional national dementia strategies (France, Germany, Netherlands, Nordic countries)
#   - Specialized topics (young-onset dementia, specific dementia types, end-of-life care)
#   - Non-English language primary sources
#   - Patient advocacy organization resources
#   - Evidence-based caregiver intervention programs
