# Metadata
# Scale: Lawton Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL) Scale
# Developers: M. Powell Lawton and Elaine M. Brody
# Year: 1969
# Publication: Lawton MP, Brody EM. Assessment of older people: self-maintaining and instrumental activities of daily living. Gerontologist. 1969;9(3):179-186.
# Scoring:
#   Original scoring: 0 (low function, dependent) to 8 (high function, independent)
#   Alternative: Sum of individual item scores (varies by item: some 0-1, some 0-3)
#   Women traditionally assessed on all 8 items
#   Men traditionally assessed on 5 items (excluding food preparation, housekeeping, laundry)
#   Modern practice: Often assess all 8 for all genders
# Score Interpretation:
#   8 points (or 23 with 3-point items) = Fully independent
#   0-1 = Severe impairment requiring substantial support
# Clinical Use: Geriatric assessment, dementia screening, care planning, research
# Reliability: Good inter-rater reliability (ICC 0.85)
# Validity: Correlates with cognitive measures and predicts institutionalization
# Gender Considerations: Original scale had gender-specific items; modern usage more egalitarian
# Typical Decline Pattern in Dementia:
#   Early: Finances, medications, transportation
#   Middle: Shopping, telephone, food preparation
#   Later: Housekeeping, laundry
# Assessment Frequency: Every 6-12 months, or when functional change observed
# Relationship to ADLs: IADLs decline before ADLs in dementia progression
# ICF Codes Reference:
#   d360 = Using communication devices and techniques
#   d3600 = Using telecommunication devices
#   d620 = Acquisition of goods and services
#   d6200 = Shopping
#   d630 = Preparing meals
#   d6300 = Preparing simple meals
#   d640 = Doing housework
#   d6400 = Washing and drying clothes and garments
#   d6405 = Cleaning living area
#   d470 = Using transportation
#   d4700 = Using human-powered vehicles
#   d570 = Looking after one's health
#   d5702 = Maintaining one's health
#   d860 = Basic economic transactions
#   d8700 = Basic economic transactions
# Usage for WP-02: These IADLs will be mapped to FAST stages (particularly stages 3-5) to determine which IADLs are impaired at each stage
# Note: IADLs are generally impaired before ADLs in dementia progression, with impairment beginning at FAST stage 3
