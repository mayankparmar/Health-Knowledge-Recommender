# Metadata
# Scale: Katz Index of Independence in Activities of Daily Living
# Developer: Sidney Katz, MD, et al.
# Year: 1963
# Publication: Katz S, Ford AB, Moskowitz RW, Jackson BA, Jaffe MW. Studies of illness in the aged: The index of ADL. JAMA. 1963;185(12):914-919.
# Scoring: Total score 0-6 (6 = high independence, 0 = very dependent)
# Score Interpretation:
#   6 points = Independent in all 6 functions
#   4 points = Moderate impairment
#   2 or less = Severe functional impairment
# Clinical Use: Widely used in geriatric assessment, long-term care planning, dementia care
# Reliability: High inter-rater reliability (kappa > 0.90)
# Validity: Strong correlation with cognitive decline and care needs
# Typical Decline Pattern in Dementia: Bathing → Dressing → Toileting → Transferring → Continence → Feeding
# Assessment Frequency: Every 3-6 months in dementia care, or when functional change observed
# ICF Codes Reference:
#   d510 = Washing oneself
#   d5101 = Washing whole body
#   d540 = Dressing
#   d5400 = Putting on clothes
#   d530 = Toileting
#   d5300 = Regulating urination
#   d420 = Transferring oneself
#   d4200 = Transferring oneself while sitting
#   d550 = Eating
#   d5500 = Eating with hands
#   b620 = Urination functions
# Usage for WP-02: These 6 ADLs will be mapped to FAST stages to determine which ADLs are impaired at each stage
