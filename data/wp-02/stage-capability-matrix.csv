# Metadata
# Stage-Capability Mapping Matrix
# Project: Health Knowledge Recommender
# Workpackage: WP-02 Stage-Capability Mapping
# Created: 2025-11-07
# Purpose: Map 16 FAST stages to ADL/IADL functional capabilities with impairment levels
#
# Impairment Levels Defined:
# - Independent: Can perform activity without any assistance
# - Requires Prompting: Can perform with verbal cues and reminders
# - Requires Assistance: Needs physical help or setup to complete activity
# - Impaired: Activity is affected but not completely dependent
# - Dependent: Cannot perform activity; complete assistance required
# - Dependent - [Specific]: Complete dependency with specific characteristic (e.g., urinary incontinence, non-ambulatory)
#
# Matrix Structure:
# - 16 FAST stages (FAST-1 through FAST-7f)
# - 6 Katz ADLs (Bathing, Dressing, Toileting, Transferring, Continence, Feeding)
# - 8 Lawton IADLs (Telephone, Shopping, Food Prep, Housekeeping, Laundry, Transportation, Medications, Finances)
# - Total entries: 16 stages × 14 capabilities = 224 stage-capability mappings
#
# Key Patterns Observed:
# - IADLs decline before ADLs (stages 3-5)
# - Complex IADLs (finances, medications, transportation) impaired earliest (stage 3-4)
# - Simpler IADLs (telephone, shopping) maintain longer (through stage 4)
# - ADL decline sequence in stages 5-6: Bathing → Dressing → Toileting → Transferring → Continence → Feeding
# - FAST 6a-6e correspond precisely to Katz ADL decline sequence
# - All IADLs completely dependent by stage 6a
# - Stage 7 (all substages) represents complete dependency in all ADLs and IADLs

# - Alzheimer's Association care guidelines and stage-specific recommendations
#
# Usage for WP-03 (Information Extraction):
# - Information items should be tagged with applicable FAST stages and capabilities
# - Information needs column provides guidance on types of information required at each stage
# - Stage-specific and capability-specific information can be precisely targeted
#
# Usage for WP-04 (Ontology Extension):
# - Each row represents an instance of stage-capability relationship
# - Impairment level becomes object property value
# - Clinical notes provide context for semantic annotations
#
# Usage for WP-06 (Query Interface):
# - Users can query by FAST stage to retrieve all capability impairments
# - Users can query by capability (e.g., "bathing") to see progression across stages
# - Impairment level enables filtering (e.g., "show me only capabilities requiring assistance")
